This project involves a neural network and image processing based system for handwriting recognition. We are working on an FPGA implementation for the same.

This is an **incomplete project** as of now.

For the other half of this project (done in collaboration with [ironstein1994](https://github.com/ironstein1994)), Please visit  [his page](https://github.com/ironstein1994/handwriting-recognition-using-neural-networks-on-FPGA-final-year-project)
