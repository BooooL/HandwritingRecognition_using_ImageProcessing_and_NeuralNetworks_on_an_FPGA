##Final year project
######Collaborators:   Riyansh Karani, Dhruv Reshamwala, Akash Rana, Kishore Saldanha

This project involves a neural network and image processing based system for handwriting recognition. We are working on an FPGA implementation for the same.

This is an **incomplete project** as of now.
